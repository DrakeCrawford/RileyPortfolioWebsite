        <p class="scenario">
            Scenario: Imagine you are with a group of friends on a Friday night and are wanting to play a game that involves sharing music.

            This benchmark test is designed to evaluate a casual, unstructured music-sharing activity. You’ll be engaging in a series of tasks focused on sharing music and discussing it with imagined friends in a relaxed setting. No technology, prompts, or formal game structure will be involved—just conversation.
            
            After completing 3 preliminary questions, you will perform 3 tasks and then answer 19 follow-up questions about your experience.
